# Systematic_errors_in_spectral_measurements_TMS
This repository contains the source code used to generate the results presented in the paper 'Systematic Errors in Spectral Measurements with the Tenerife Microwave Spectrometer'. It includes the computational models developed for Jones matrices and Friis transmission equations to characterize the instrument's signal chain.
